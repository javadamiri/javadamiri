Hi ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Javad Amiri :trollface: (@javadamiri).

I'm a software developer with experience in operating system and language runtime development for real-time and high-performance systems.

I'm interested (and very capable :muscle: ) in improving reliability and performance in large-scale multi-language concurrent software.

I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and applying my expertise in new domains.
